<h2> Description </h2>

My Academy trainer application represents the necessary interfaces for a trainer in a training center including: 
*  Authentification interface : where the trainer puts his login and password to access the application
*  Home page : where the trainer is able to check his daily classes or simply logout.
*  Each course class : where the trainer is able to point out the presence of his students and save the end of the class.
*  Hidden drawer: where the trainer can choose where to go next (make the navigation between interfaces easier).
*  Profile : where the trainer is able to check his information.
*  Students lists : where the trainer can check his trainees list per each session of each training course.
*  Calendar : where the trainer is able to check his classes of each day.

Note: This code is a static code, which means it only shows the interfaces and it is not related to a backend.
